You can use the Borland Command Line Resource Compiler (BRCC.EXE and
BRCC32.EXE) that ships with Delphi and C++ Builder, or a WYSIWYG
resource editor such as Borland\'s Resource Workshop 5.0 that ships with
the Borland RAD Pack. The Resource Workshop 5.0 can compile and
decompile both 16 and 32 bit resources from .rc, .res, .exe, .dll, .drv,
.vbx, .cpl, .ico,. bmp, .rle, .dlg, fnt, and cur files.
