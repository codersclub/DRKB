<p>Why am I getting runtime error 230 when running my application outside of the Kylix IDE?</p>
<p>This error generally means your application cannot find a needed library. </p>
<p>Tunning the command&nbsp; source \kylix\bin\kylixpath&nbsp; in Linux should fix this. See the file deploy.txt that comes with Kylix. </p>
