<h1>Should I install Kylix as root or a regular user?</h1>

<p>Installing Kylix as root has the advantage of allowing all users to access the Kylix installation, provided you install it into a "shared" location. I reccomend installing Kylix as root into the directory /usr/local/kylix. However, if you are going to be the only user using Kylix, you may want to install it as that user into your home directory.</p>
<p>To install as root, type su from the command prompt and enter the super user password. Then, run the Kylix installer.</p>
<p class="note">Примечание от Vit</p>
<p>Обычно при установке от имени root возникает ошибка -10</p>
