<h1>Error: Interface not supported</h1>

<p>I receive an "Interface is not supported" error when trying to use an interface.</p>
<p>Verify that STDVCL32.DLL and your type library are registered.&nbsp; If casting an interface, you must be using DCOM and the type library must be registered on the client.</p>
