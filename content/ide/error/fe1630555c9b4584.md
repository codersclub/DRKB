========================

When I try to add a resource to my project\'s .res file, I get a
\"Duplicate Resource\" error when linking. The resource I have added is
a unique resource. How can I successfully add the resource to my
project?

The projects resource file is generated by the IDE wizard, and is not
intended to be modified. To add additional resources to your project,
create a separate resource file with a unique name that does not
conflict with either the project or any of  the unit names. Then to add
the resource file to Delphi, simply add the following line to any unit
file in the project:

[{\$R MyRes.Res}]{style="color: teal;"}

(where MyRes.Res is the name of the resource file).

To add the resource to Borland\'s C++ Builder, add the resource

from the project manager.
