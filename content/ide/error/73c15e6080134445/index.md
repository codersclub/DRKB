Hidden or missing IDE
=====================

Occasionally in Delphi 5 the IDE will \'disappear\'. This is to say you
will launch Delphi, and most or all of your IDE will not be visible.
Delphi is clearly running and working, as you can still use your hot
keys and run and compile a program, you just can\'t see such useful
items such as the object inspector or your component tool bar.

This is caused by Delphi saving bogus information in its desktop
preference files, or \'.dsk\' files. Delphi saves information about your
environment options and settings in these files. In order to see your
IDE again, all you need to do is delete these offending files. This will
in no way harm Delphi or your project, as Delphi will dynamically
generate these files as it needs them. You will however lose any
environment settings that you had set previously.
