Limit reached for installs using Kylix serial number
====================================================

::: {.date}

I am attempting to register Kylix, but cannot and get the following
error:

--------------------

Error registering software. The limit has been reached for installs
using this serial number, please contact customer service to increase
the allowed install count.

--------------------

How do I get around this and register Kylix?     

Borland has a registration server that keeps count of how many times a
product has been registered. The default count is five registrations.
This error indicates that your serial number has already been registered
five times, and the registration currently being attempted exceeds the
count.

You can get this count increased by calling Borland\'s registration
hotline at (888) 588-2230. Explain to the representative who answers the
phone what product you have, as well as the full error message, and he
or she (after asking for your relevant information) will be able to
increase the count to allow for additional registrations.
