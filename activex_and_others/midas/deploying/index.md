Deploying Midas
===============

You need to purchase a MIDAS license for the application server. When
you purchase a MIDAS license you receive a CD with the MIDAS suite for
install.  You need to install the

EXE\'s and DLL\'s that you created for your app, the rest (which also
includes the runtime packages, BDE, SQL Links, etc.) are installed by
the MIDAS software.
